### Part 7 - Questions (and your Answers)

Acme Corporation isn't just a few `.py` files. If you want to grow in your
career here, you'll have to answer the following:

-* What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
  something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
  when others do the same for your code?

--An important part of reviewing code is to make sure your logic is understandable to outside parties. Code reviews can help a coder
improve the readability, useability, and reproducibility of the code. Can help a coder recieve comments and a new perspective perhaps on the work.

When I review code its all about understanding layout(hopefully code runs in order)and documentation. If I can get a general idea of what the coder is trying to accomplish by reading comments then they succeded.

I appreciate almost every kind of feedback to my code but especailly negative feedback to grow upon since I'm not a professional yet.


* We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
  slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
  improve this situation?

-- Containers can increase the portability of our company's system of information while carrying less overhead. Compared to virtual machines, it requires less system resources since it does not contain operating system images. A container can still provide a lot of the functionality needed with the necessary binary code, executables, libraries and configuration files. 
Acme will find that the containers can provide more
consistent operation that runs the same regardless of where the many computers are located and what is run on them. Containters can offer improvements in efficiency where applications can be more quickly scaled, patched or deployed which helps in agile development and production
cycles.
